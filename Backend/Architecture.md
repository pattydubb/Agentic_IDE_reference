# Backend Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the backend architecture, including the framework, design patterns, and structural components.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Framework name, e.g., Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails]
- **Language**: [Programming language, e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby]
- **Database ORM**: [ORM tool, e.g., Sequelize, Django ORM, Active Record]
- **API Style**: RESTful / GraphQL / Hybrid
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth2 / Session-based

## Architectural Pattern

This application follows a [pattern name, e.g., MVC, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture] pattern with the following components:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Implement business logic
- **Models**: Define data structures and database schemas
- **Repositories**: Manage data access and database operations
- **Middleware**: Process requests before they reach the controller

## Directory Structure

```

├── controllers/    # HTTP request handlers
├── models/         # Data models and schemas
├── services/       # Business logic
├── middleware/     # Request processors
├── utils/          # Helper functions
├── config/         # Configuration files
├── routes/         # API route definitions
└── tests/          # Unit and integration tests
```

## Request Lifecycle

1. **Request Received**: The application receives an HTTP request
2. **Middleware Processing**: Request passes through authentication, validation, and other middleware
3. **Routing**: Request is routed to the appropriate controller
4. **Controller Logic**: Controller processes the request and calls necessary services
5. **Service Operations**: Services implement business logic and interact with repositories
6. **Data Access**: Repositories handle database operations
7. **Response Formation**: Controller formats the data into a response
8. **Response Sent**: The application sends the HTTP response back to the client

## Error Handling

The application implements a centralized error handling mechanism that:
- Catches all exceptions thrown during request processing
- Formats error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Logs errors for monitoring and debugging

## Security Measures

- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system with token refresh
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for protected resources
- **Input Validation**: Validation middleware for all incoming requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of recommended HTTP security headers

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries and optimized schemas
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background jobs for resource-intensive operations

## Deployment Architecture

- **Environment Strategy**: Development, Staging, Production
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent environment management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with load balancing
