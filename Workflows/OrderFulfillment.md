# Order Fulfillment Workflow

This document outlines the end-to-end business process for order fulfillment in the application.

## Overview

The order fulfillment process manages the lifecycle of an order from initial placement through payment processing, inventory management, shipping, and delivery confirmation. This workflow ensures orders are accurately fulfilled while maintaining inventory integrity and providing customers with order status updates.

## Process Flow

```
Order Placement → Payment Processing → Inventory Check → Order Preparation → Shipping → Delivery Confirmation
```

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Order Placement

**Description**: Customer places an order through the application.

**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Checkout component (`Frontend/Components/Checkout/CheckoutForm.md`)
- Backend: Order creation endpoint (`/api/orders` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Order service (`Services/Order.md`)

**User Flow**:
1. Customer adds products to cart
2. Customer proceeds to checkout
3. Customer provides shipping and billing information
4. Customer selects payment method
5. Customer submits order
6. System creates order record with "pending" status
7. System initiates payment processing

**Success Criteria**:
- Order record created in database
- Payment processing initiated
- Order confirmation displayed to customer
- Order confirmation email sent

### 2. Payment Processing

**Description**: System processes payment for the order.

**Implementation**:
- Backend: Payment processing endpoint (`/api/payments` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Payment service (`Services/Payments.md`)

**System Flow**:
1. System sends payment request to payment processor
2. Payment processor validates payment details
3. If successful, system updates order status to "paid"
4. If failed, system updates order status to "payment_failed" and notifies customer
5. System records payment transaction details

**Success Criteria**:
- Payment successfully processed
- Payment transaction recorded
- Order status updated
- Customer notified of payment status

### 3. Inventory Check

**Description**: System checks inventory availability for ordered items.

**Implementation**:
- Backend: Inventory check endpoint (`/api/inventory/check` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Inventory service (`Services/Inventory.md`)

**System Flow**:
1. System checks availability of each ordered item
2. If all items available, system reserves inventory
3. If any items unavailable, system updates order status to "backorder" or "partially_fulfilled"
4. System notifies customer of any inventory issues

**Success Criteria**:
- Inventory verified for all items
- Inventory reserved for available items
- Order status updated based on availability
- Customer notified of any backorders

### 4. Order Preparation

**Description**: Warehouse staff prepares the order for shipping.

**Implementation**:
- Backend: Order management endpoints (`/api/orders/{id}/status` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Frontend: Order management interface (`Frontend/Components/Admin/OrderManagement.md`)

**Staff Flow**:
1. Staff receives order preparation notification
2. Staff picks items from inventory
3. Staff packages items
4. Staff generates shipping label
5. Staff updates order status to "prepared"
6. System decrements inventory for shipped items

**Success Criteria**:
- Order prepared for shipping
- Shipping label generated
- Inventory updated
- Order status updated to "prepared"

### 5. Shipping

**Description**: Order is shipped to the customer.

**Implementation**:
- Backend: Shipping integration endpoints (`/api/shipping` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Shipping service (`Services/Shipping.md`)

**Staff Flow**:
1. Staff selects shipping carrier and service
2. Staff enters package dimensions and weight
3. Staff confirms shipping details
4. System generates tracking number
5. Staff hands package to carrier
6. Staff updates order status to "shipped"
7. System sends shipping confirmation to customer

**Success Criteria**:
- Shipping carrier and service selected
- Tracking number generated and recorded
- Order status updated to "shipped"
- Shipping confirmation sent to customer

### 6. Delivery Confirmation

**Description**: System confirms delivery of the order.

**Implementation**:
- Backend: Delivery tracking endpoint (`/api/shipping/tracking` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Shipping service (`Services/Shipping.md`)

**System Flow**:
1. System periodically checks shipping status with carrier API
2. When delivered, system updates order status to "delivered"
3. System sends delivery confirmation to customer
4. System triggers post-purchase follow-up sequence

**Success Criteria**:
- Delivery confirmed with carrier
- Order status updated to "delivered"
- Delivery confirmation sent to customer
- Post-purchase sequence initiated

## Integration Points

| Integration | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Payment Gateway | Process payments | Integration with payment service (`Services/Payments.md`) |
| Inventory System | Manage inventory levels | Integration with inventory service (`Services/Inventory.md`) |
| Shipping Carriers | Generate labels and track shipments | Integration with shipping service (`Services/Shipping.md`) |
| Email Service | Send notifications | Integration with notification service (`Services/Notifications.md`) |
| SMS Provider | Send SMS notifications | Integration with notification service (`Services/Notifications.md`) |

## Exception Handling

| Exception | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| Payment Failure | Retry payment or request alternative payment method, adjust order status |
| Inventory Shortage | Place affected items on backorder, notify customer, offer alternatives |
| Shipping Carrier Issues | Provide alternative carrier options, adjust estimated delivery dates |
| Return Request | Initiate return workflow, generate return label, process refund |
| Order Cancellation | Confirm cancellation eligibility, release inventory, process refund if paid |

## Performance Considerations

- Batch process shipping label generation during off-peak hours
- Implement queuing for payment processing during high-volume periods
- Cache frequently accessed order data for quick retrieval
- Schedule regular inventory synchronization checks
- Implement background processing for notification delivery
