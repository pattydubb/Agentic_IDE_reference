# User Onboarding Workflow

This document outlines the end-to-end business process for user onboarding in the application.

## Overview

The user onboarding process guides new users from initial registration through completing their profile and experiencing key features of the application. The goal is to provide a smooth introduction to the application's value while collecting necessary user information.

## Process Flow

```
Registration → Email Verification → Profile Completion → Welcome Tour → First Action
```

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Registration

**Description**: User creates a new account by providing basic information.

**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Registration form component (`Frontend/Components/Auth/RegisterForm.md`)
- Backend: Registration endpoint (`/api/auth/register` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Authentication service (`Services/Authentication.md`)

**User Flow**:
1. User navigates to the registration page
2. User enters email, password, and other required fields
3. System validates input and checks for existing users
4. System creates a new user record with "unverified" status
5. System sends verification email
6. User is shown confirmation page with next steps

**Success Criteria**:
- User record created in database
- Verification email sent successfully
- User directed to verification pending page

### 2. Email Verification

**Description**: User verifies their email address to activate their account.

**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Email verification component (`Frontend/Components/Auth/EmailVerification.md`)
- Backend: Verification endpoint (`/api/auth/verify` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: Authentication service (`Services/Authentication.md`)

**User Flow**:
1. User receives verification email
2. User clicks verification link
3. System validates verification token
4. System updates user status to "verified"
5. User is redirected to profile completion page

**Success Criteria**:
- User status updated to "verified"
- Verification token marked as used
- User redirected to profile completion

### 3. Profile Completion

**Description**: User completes their profile with additional information.

**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Profile completion form (`Frontend/Components/Profile/ProfileCompletion.md`)
- Backend: Profile update endpoint (`/api/users/profile` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)
- Service: User service (`Services/User.md`)

**User Flow**:
1. User arrives at profile completion page
2. User enters additional information (name, preferences, etc.)
3. User uploads profile picture (optional)
4. System validates and saves information
5. User is directed to welcome tour

**Success Criteria**:
- User profile information saved
- Profile completion status updated
- User directed to welcome tour

### 4. Welcome Tour

**Description**: Interactive tour that introduces key features of the application.

**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Tour component (`Frontend/Components/Onboarding/WelcomeTour.md`)
- Backend: Tour progress endpoint (`/api/onboarding/tour-progress` in `Backend/Endpoints.md`)

**User Flow**:
1. User is shown a series of tooltips highlighting key features
2. User can navigate through the tour at their own pace
3. System tracks completed tour steps
4. User can skip the tour if desired
5. Upon completion, user is guided to perform their first action

**Success Criteria**:
- Tour presented to user
- Tour progress tracked
- User guided to first action

### 5. First Action

**Description**: User completes their first meaningful action in the application.

**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Various components related to the action
- Backend: Relevant endpoints for the action
- Service: Relevant services for the action

**User Flow**:
1. User is guided to perform a specific action (e.g., create first item, connect first integration)
2. System provides contextual help
3. User completes the action
4. System acknowledges completion and provides next steps
5. Onboarding process is marked as complete

**Success Criteria**:
- User completes first action
- Onboarding status marked as complete
- User enters normal application flow

## Data Model

### User Onboarding Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_onboarding (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  registration_completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  email_verified_at TIMESTAMP,
  profile_completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  welcome_tour_completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  first_action_completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  is_onboarding_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);
```

## Analytics Events

Throughout the onboarding process, the following analytics events are tracked:

| Event | Description | Properties |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `user_registered` | User completed registration | `userId`, `source`, `timestamp` |
| `email_verified` | User verified email | `userId`, `timeToVerify`, `timestamp` |
| `profile_completed` | User completed profile | `userId`, `fieldsCompleted`, `timestamp` |
| `tour_started` | User started welcome tour | `userId`, `timestamp` |
| `tour_step_viewed` | User viewed tour step | `userId`, `stepId`, `timestamp` |
| `tour_completed` | User completed tour | `userId`, `stepsCompleted`, `timestamp` |
| `tour_skipped` | User skipped tour | `userId`, `lastStepViewed`, `timestamp` |
| `first_action_completed` | User completed first action | `userId`, `actionType`, `timestamp` |
| `onboarding_completed` | User completed full onboarding | `userId`, `timeToComplete`, `timestamp` |

## Notifications

The onboarding process includes the following notifications:

| Notification | Channel | Timing | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|--------|---------|
| Welcome Email | Email | After registration | Welcome user and provide verification link |
| Verification Reminder | Email | 24h after registration if not verified | Remind user to verify email |
| Profile Completion Reminder | Email | 24h after verification if profile not completed | Encourage profile completion |
| Onboarding Complete | In-app, Email | After first action | Congratulate user on completing onboarding |

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| User tries to log in before verification | Show message explaining verification requirement with option to resend email |
| Verification link expires | Provide option to request a new verification link |
| User abandons profile completion | Save partial progress and allow resuming, send reminder email |
| User closes browser during tour | Track progress and resume from last viewed step on next login |
| User creates multiple accounts | Detect accounts with same email and provide option to merge or select active account |

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy load tour assets to ensure fast initial page load
- Pre-fetch next step content to ensure smooth tour progression
- Optimize email delivery for quick verification
- Minimize required fields in registration to reduce friction

## Accessibility Requirements

- All onboarding steps must be keyboard navigable
- Tour tooltips must be accessible to screen readers
- Form validation errors must be clearly communicated
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards
- Provide alternative text for all images
