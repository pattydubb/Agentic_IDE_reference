### Database Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Connection Failed** | Error: "Cannot connect to database..." | - Verify database is running.<br>- Check connection string.<br>- Ensure network allows connection.<br>- Verify credentials. |
| **Migration Failed** | Error during migration: "Migration failed..." | - Check migration scripts for errors.<br>- Verify database schema state.<br>- Run migrations one by one to identify issue. |
| **Query Error** | Error message related to SQL syntax or constraints | - Review query syntax.<br>- Check for schema compatibility.<br>- Verify data types and constraints. |
| **Deadlock Detected** | Error: "Deadlock detected..." | - Optimize query order.<br>- Add retry logic for affected operations.<br>- Review transaction isolation levels. |
| **Timeout Error** | Query execution times out | - Optimize query performance.<br>- Add appropriate indexes.<br>- Increase timeout setting if possible. |

### Dependency Management Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Package Not Found** | Error: "Package 'xyz' not found..." | - Check package name and version.<br>- Verify package registry is accessible.<br>- Try clearing package cache. |
| **Version Conflict** | Error: "Conflicting dependency versions..." | - Update project dependencies.<br>- Use a specific version that resolves conflict.<br>- Check compatibility requirements. |
| **Installation Failed** | Error during package installation | - Check network connectivity.<br>- Verify disk space.<br>- Look for specific error messages in logs. |
| **Corrupted Package** | Unexpected behavior or errors when using a package | - Delete `node_modules` folder and reinstall.<br>- Clean package cache.<br>- Install a different version. |
| **Unmet Peer Dependency** | Warning: "Unmet peer dependency..." | - Install the required peer dependency.<br>- Update the package to a version with compatible peers.<br>- Ignore if the warning doesn't affect functionality. |

### IDE Performance Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Slow Response** | IDE operations taking longer than expected | - Close unused files and tabs.<br>- Reduce the size of the workspace.<br>- Check system resources (CPU, memory). |
| **High Memory Usage** | IDE consuming excessive memory | - Restart the IDE.<br>- Disable memory-intensive features or extensions.<br>- Increase memory allocation if possible. |
| **Freezing or Hanging** | IDE becomes unresponsive | - Force quit and restart the IDE.<br>- Check for infinite loops in workspace code.<br>- Disable problematic extensions. |
| **Indexing Problems** | Search or intellisense not working correctly | - Rebuild project indexes.<br>- Clear IDE caches.<br>- Restart the IDE. |
| **Editor Lag** | Typing or scrolling has noticeable delay | - Reduce file size or split into smaller files.<br>- Disable syntax highlighting for large files.<br>- Check for problematic extensions. |

### Build and Compilation Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Build Failed** | Error messages during build process | - Check compiler output for specific errors.<br>- Verify syntax in recently changed files.<br>- Ensure all dependencies are installed. |
| **Missing Configuration** | Error: "Cannot find configuration file..." | - Create the required configuration file.<br>- Check file path and name.<br>- Copy from templates if available. |
| **Outdated Cache** | Stale build artifacts causing issues | - Clean build cache.<br>- Rebuild project from scratch.<br>- Delete temporary build files. |
| **Environment Variables Not Set** | Build fails due to missing environment variables | - Set required environment variables.<br>- Create or update `.env` file.<br>- Check for typos in variable names. |
| **Wrong Platform Build** | Build works locally but fails in CI/deployment | - Check platform-specific configurations.<br>- Ensure consistent environments.<br>- Use CI/CD tools that match production. |

### Debugging Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Debugger Won't Connect** | Cannot start debugging session | - Check debugger configuration.<br>- Verify port settings and availability.<br>- Restart the application and IDE. |
| **Breakpoints Not Hitting** | Execution doesn't stop at breakpoints | - Verify source maps are correctly generated.<br>- Ensure code isn't optimized out.<br>- Check if breakpoints are in executed code paths. |
| **Cannot Inspect Variables** | Variables show as undefined or unavailable | - Check scope of variables.<br>- Verify debug information is being generated.<br>- Use watch expressions for complex objects. |
| **Debugger Performance** | Debugging session is very slow | - Reduce the number of breakpoints.<br>- Limit watch expressions.<br>- Disable unnecessary debug features. |
| **Source Maps Issues** | Debugging shows wrong file or location | - Regenerate source maps.<br>- Ensure source map configuration is correct.<br>- Verify file paths in source maps. |

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Cannot find module 'X'"
- **Cause**: Module not installed or not in the correct location
- **Solution**: 
  ```
  npm install X
  ```
  or check import path for typos

### "X is not defined"
- **Cause**: Variable or function used before declaration or import
- **Solution**: Check that all variables are properly declared and imports are correct

### "TypeError: X is not a function"
- **Cause**: Trying to call something that isn't a function
- **Solution**: Check variable types and ensure object methods exist before calling

### "ECONNREFUSED when connecting to localhost:XXXX"
- **Cause**: Service not running on expected port
- **Solution**: Start the required local service or check port configuration

### "Uncaught promise rejection"
- **Cause**: Unhandled error in promise
- **Solution**: Add proper catch handlers to promises or use try/catch with async/await

## Preventive Measures

To avoid common issues, follow these best practices:

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Commit changes frequently
   - Push to remote repositories
   - Use IDE's local history feature if available

2. **Project Hygiene**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Document environment requirements

3. **Testing Practices**
   - Write tests for critical functionality
   - Run tests before committing changes
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling in code
   - Log errors with meaningful context
   - Create user-friendly error messages

5. **Documentation**
   - Document known issues and workarounds
   - Keep README files updated
   - Comment complex or non-obvious code
