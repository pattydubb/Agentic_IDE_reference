# Payments Service

This document provides documentation for the payments service, which handles payment processing, subscriptions, and billing management.

## Service Overview

The payments service is responsible for:
- Processing one-time payments
- Managing recurring subscriptions
- Handling refunds and disputes
- Tracking payment history
- Generating invoices and receipts

## Implementation Details

### Payment Provider

This application uses [Provider Name, e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Braintree] for payment processing.

### Configuration

```javascript
// Configuration settings for payment service
const paymentConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.PAYMENT_API_KEY,
  apiSecret: process.env.PAYMENT_API_SECRET,
  webhookSecret: process.env.PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  currency: 'USD',
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'live' : 'sandbox'
};
```

## Payment Flows

### One-Time Payment Flow

1. User selects product/service and proceeds to checkout
2. Frontend collects payment details securely using provider's SDK
3. Frontend sends payment token to backend
4. Backend creates payment intent/charge with the payment provider
5. Backend confirms payment and updates order status
6. Backend sends confirmation to frontend
7. User receives success message and receipt

### Subscription Flow

1. User selects subscription plan
2. User enters payment details
3. Backend creates subscription with the payment provider
4. Payment provider handles recurring billing
5. Backend receives webhook notifications for subscription events
6. Backend updates subscription status in the database

## Pricing Models

The application supports the following pricing models:
- **One-time payments**: Single charge for product/service
- **Recurring subscriptions**: Monthly or annual billing
- **Usage-based billing**: Pay based on consumption
- **Tiered pricing**: Different features at different price points
- **Free trials**: Time-limited access without payment

## Subscription Plans

| Plan Name | Price | Billing Cycle | Features |
|-----------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Basic     | $9.99 | Monthly       | Feature 1, Feature 2 |
| Premium   | $19.99 | Monthly      | All Basic features + Feature 3, Feature 4 |
| Enterprise | $49.99 | Monthly     | All Premium features + Feature 5, Feature 6 |
| Annual Basic | $99.99 | Annually  | Same as Basic with 16% discount |
| Annual Premium | $199.99 | Annually | Same as Premium with 16% discount |
| Annual Enterprise | $499.99 | Annually | Same as Enterprise with 16% discount |

## Payment Webhooks

The payment service handles the following webhook events from the payment provider:

| Event | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `payment.succeeded` | Payment completed successfully | Update order status, send confirmation |
| `payment.failed` | Payment attempt failed | Notify user, suggest alternative payment method |
| `subscription.created` | New subscription started | Activate user's subscription features |
| `subscription.updated` | Subscription plan changed | Update subscription in database |
| `subscription.cancelled` | Subscription cancelled | Deactivate features at end of billing period |
| `subscription.payment_failed` | Subscription payment failed | Notify user, attempt retry, schedule cancellation |
| `invoice.paid` | Invoice payment succeeded | Update billing records, send receipt |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Invoice payment failed | Notify user, attempt to collect payment |
| `refund.created` | Refund issued | Update order status, notify user |

## Integration with Frontend

### Checkout Example

```javascript
// Frontend checkout implementation
const initiateCheckout = async (productId, quantity) => {
  try {
    // Get checkout session from backend
    const response = await api.post('/payments/create-checkout', {
      productId,
      quantity
    });
    
    const { sessionId } = response.data;
    
    // Redirect to payment provider checkout
    const stripe = await loadStripe(STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY);
    await stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Checkout failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### Subscription Management Example

```javascript
// Frontend subscription management
const updateSubscription = async (subscriptionId, newPlanId) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post('/payments/update-subscription', {
      subscriptionId,
      newPlanId
    });
    
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Subscription update failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Security Considerations

- **PCI Compliance**: The application does not store credit card details directly
- **HTTPS Only**: All payment requests must use HTTPS
- **Webhook Validation**: All incoming webhooks are validated using signature verification
- **Idempotency Keys**: Used to prevent duplicate processing of payments
- **Fraud Prevention**: Implementation of address verification and 3D Secure

## Testing

The payment service includes a sandbox environment for testing without real money:
- Test credit cards with various scenarios (success, decline, etc.)
- Simulated subscription lifecycle events
- Webhook testing tools

## Refund and Dispute Handling

The system supports the following refund scenarios:
- Full refunds
- Partial refunds
- Refunds with reason tracking
- Manual and automated dispute handling
